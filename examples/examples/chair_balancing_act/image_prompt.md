# Image Generation Prompt — Chair Balancing Act

## Prompt

A product visualization of a small, round electronic device called "Chair Balancing Act." The device is 32 mm in diameter and 10 mm thick — about the size of an Apple AirTag. It has a flat dark enclosure with a small red button on the edge and thin speaker slots cut into one side. A CR2450 coin cell battery is visible through a translucent lid on top.

Show two views in a single image:

1. The device by itself, slightly angled to show both the top face and the slim profile. Clean white background, soft studio lighting, product-photo style.

2. The device mounted with an adhesive pad to the underside of a simple four-legged wooden school chair or dining chair. The chair is tilting backward on its rear legs at about 15 degrees. Small curved lines near the device suggest sound emanating from the speaker slots. The person sitting is only partially visible (legs and torso, no face needed), leaning back casually.

Style: clean product rendering, minimal, slightly playful. No text overlays. Neutral background.
